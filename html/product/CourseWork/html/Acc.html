                   <p class=" descriptionfonts para">
                    Improving upon many aspects of the Inspire 2, the DJI Inspire 3 Drone keeps up with the advancements and needs of film 
                    and television producers, allowing filmmakers to capture creative and stunning results.
                    <span id="dronedots">...</span><span id="dronemore">
                        It begins with the X9-8K Air, an 8K, full-frame, 3-axis, gimbal camera custom-built for the Inspire 3. It joins a new
                        1/1.8" FPV camera with double the DFOV of the Inspire 2. Together, they help capture professional footage and complex 
                        shots thanks to a customizable obstacle avoidance system, built-in centimeter-level RTK accuracy, and tracking solutions 
                        that allow accurate and repeatable shots.
                        8K X9-8K Air Gimbal
                        The heart of the Inspire 3 is the custom-built X9-8K Air gimbal that uses CineCore 3.0, DJI's latest image processing
                         system to internally record up to 8K25 CinemaDNG video or 8K75 Apple ProRes RAW video, both meeting the needs of professional 
                         film and television productions. The footage retains a lifelike texture that's close to what the human eye can see, allowing
                          for enough space for adding visual effects and color grading. Complex lighting sources are supported with 14+ stops of 
                          dynamic range and the use of the DJI cinema Color System authenticity in recording everything from urban landscapes to a 
                          variety of skin tones. Additional features include:

                   <p class=" descriptionfonts para">
                    Designed to control the DJI Inspire 3, the DJI RC Plus remote controller gives pilots classic controls, a selection
                     of integrated buttons and dials<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">, and a built-in 7" display. The display 
                        is made to show the live feed from the Inspire 3, along with essential telemetry, such as camera exposure, video
                         specs, focal length, and gimbal angle. When it comes to film and TV production, time is money, which is why DJI 
                         used a bright 1200-nit display so it can be used easily outdoors in the daylight. <br>
                    <b>Hot-Swappable Battery</b><br>
                    The battery of the RC Plus supports hot swapping, which means you can replace the battery as needed to extend operation 
                    beyond the 3.3 hours of a single battery charge.<br>
                    <b>HDMI Output</b> <br>
                    Creating a film, show, or commercial is often a collaborative process. The built-in HDMI port on the DJI RC Plus helps 
                    to assist in that process by outputting the live feed from the Inspire 3 to an optional external monitor.

                        an easy-to-use, truly wireless digital microphone/recorder system that offers vivid audio quality while supplying all the
                         elements needed to simultaneously capture two subjects to a DSLR/mirrorless cameras or iOS/Android smartphone. The system 
                         records clear and reliable audio at up to 820' via two miniature clip-on omnidirectional mics/transmitters, which double 
                         as backup recorders for worry-free wireless. The tiny receiver can either be mounted on a DSLR camera or DJI Action 2 
                         camera or plugged directly into the Lightning/USB port of a smartphone or laptop. With Fast Pairing, the transmitters 
                         and the receiver automatically charge and pair as soon as you place them in the charging case. Simply complete the initial
                          setup and you can be ready to record quality audio in seconds.
